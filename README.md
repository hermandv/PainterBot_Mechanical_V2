# PainterBot
Inventor project for a Painter robot that is used to paint with waterpaint using interchangeable brushes and pens. The hardware is a simple XYZ axis painterbot that use a GRBL controller to process gcode send to it either in realtime or from a file.

# Details on the tool holder interface:
The tool grips were implemented using a cup and cone interface. It uses a magnet to hold the tools in place and a solenoid is used to push the tool out when changing to another. For the cup I used the cap of a spray bottle that is glued into the tool holder 3D printed part. The cone is made of 2 part putty that was formed in another spray bottle cap with an embedded washer on the one side and the brush/pen on the other.
